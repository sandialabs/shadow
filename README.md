Shadow is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) based library for semi-supervised machine learning.
The `shadow` python 3 package includes implementations of Virtual Adversarial Training,
Mean Teacher, and Exponential Averaging Adversarial Training.
Semi-supervised learning enables training a model (gold dashed line) from both labeled (red and
blue) and unlabeled (grey) data, and is typically used in contexts in which labels are expensive
to obtain but unlabeled examples are plentiful.
